# sm-clone-mockup

Your first major project will be to create a Twitter clone. This will be a social media site that registered users will use to create, read, update, and delete posts. But first, we're starting off with the design phase and mapping out what the app will look like.

Here are four videos that are a “How To Use Figma” tutorial:

	• Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQ7IHkTiMM
  
	• Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvFd-z7jSaA
  
	• Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIeZ2ahEkQ

Here are links to SME Demo wireframes as a reference:

	• https://www.figma.com/file/37qupmidcUFbfT8RcwbKSo/FED2303_SM-Login

You are to use this wireframe as a reference and flesh out a fully designed mockup that will eventually be the front facing UI of your application. Please keep in mind, you will be building this page out in code at a later date. I want everyone to be creative and design something unique, but understand that too many bells and whistles can become a problem overall. Start simple and work into more advanced features.

## Business ask / Business Analyst Notes
( In a lot of software development teams you have dedicated people known as business analysts (BAs) whose job is to meet with business along with the Product Owner and find out what business wants.)

	• Create a Figma account and create a new DRAFT (draft gives you unlimited pages, don't worry about creating a team)
  
	• Customize a wireframe to include your own color scheme (it can be a light theme or dark theme, but does NOT need to be both), images, and font.
  
		• You can take creative liberties with this: if you want to change the shape of the posts or the icons, you can.
    
	• Recreate ALL PAGES
  
		• Needs to have a Login Page, and Main Feed Page
    
		• Both pages need to have a DESKTOP and MOBILE view for them
    
		• Make sure each page is consistent in style with the last
    
		• Give your Twitter clone a name, not just "Twitter Clone" and not what I've named my mockup, either.
    
		• Creating a logo is OPTIONAL
    
		• You can use other prototypes for color palette inspiration, but don't change the layout so that it's replicating that exact prototype already out there

## Task
Twitter Clone Mockup 

## Description
( this is typically defined by the scrum team as a whole, after listening to business asks ) 
As a new frontend student I need to create a Figma wireframe for my twitter clone application. This wireframe must include both a desktop and mobile view for all pages designed as well as a unifying theme and assets.
 
## Acceptance Criteria
( these are all the must haves. No exceptions )

	• Must have a Login Page
  
	• Must Have news feed Page
  
	• Must have unifying theme
  
	• Must be responsive design (Mobile and Desktop View)
  
	• Must have a unique name 
	
## Stretch Goals
( in most software development team, this is defined by the product owner in a scrum team, google for further info)

	* Logo creation 
	
## Points: 3 
( Points are typically defined by the team that will be doing the work . It is based on the Fibonacci sequence and is an approximation of effort. This is heavily dependent of the individuals pointing and much conversation goes into it since something that may take me a day could take you two. For today's purpose we will say that 3 points is a 2-3 days worth of effort )
